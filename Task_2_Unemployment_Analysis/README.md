About the Project

In this project, I analyzed unemployment rate data of India using Python.
The main goal was to understand how unemployment changed over time, especially during the Covid-19 period, and to identify any noticeable patterns in the data.

Unemployment rate is an important indicator of a country’s economic condition, so analyzing this data helps in understanding economic performance.

Objectives

Clean and preprocess the unemployment dataset

Analyze unemployment trends over time

Study the impact of Covid-19

Identify monthly/seasonal patterns

Draw meaningful conclusions from the data

Tools Used

Python

Pandas

Matplotlib

Dataset Information

The dataset contains monthly unemployment data of different states in India.

Columns in the dataset include:

Region

Date

Estimated Unemployment Rate (%)

Estimated Employed

Labour Participation Rate (%)

Area (Rural/Urban)

Steps Performed

Imported the dataset using pandas

Cleaned the data (removed missing values and formatted date column)

Sorted the dataset by date

Calculated monthly average unemployment rate

Plotted graphs to visualize trends

Compared pre-Covid and during-Covid unemployment rates

Performed seasonal analysis

Key Observations

Before Covid (before March 2020), unemployment rate was around 9–10%.

During Covid lockdown months, unemployment increased sharply.

April and May 2020 showed the highest unemployment levels.

After lockdown restrictions were relaxed, unemployment started decreasing gradually.

Insights

Covid-19 had a major short-term impact on employment.

Lockdowns significantly affected jobs, especially in urban areas.

Economic shocks can quickly increase unemployment rates.

Government support programs are important during such crises.

Conclusion

From this analysis, it is clear that unemployment rates were relatively stable before Covid-19. However, the pandemic caused a sudden spike in unemployment.

This project helped me understand how real-world data can reflect economic changes and how Python can be used for data analysis and visualization.

Future Improvements

State-wise comparison of unemployment

Rural vs Urban detailed analysis

Time series forecasting

Interactive dashboard creation
